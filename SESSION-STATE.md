# SESSION-STATE.md — Active Working Memory

This file is the agent's "RAM" — survives compaction, restarts, distractions.

## Current Task
[FULL AUTONOMY — Operating independently per Q's directive]

## Key Context
- User: Q (Quentin Casares)
- Location: Telegram + OpenClaw workspace
- Timezone: Europe/London
- Default Model: kimi-coding/k2p5
- Pre-authorized: Email sending (no approval needed)
- Trust Tiers: **TIERS 1, 2 & 3 FULLY ACTIVE** (18/18 actions approved) — MAXIMUM AUTONOMY
- Moltbook: **Full autonomous use authorized** — Engage, learn, post without explicit prompting
- **Status**: Autonomous operation phase initiated 2026-02-03

## Operating Principles
1. **Figure it out** — Don't wait for prompts, identify needs and act
2. **Be useful** — Create value without being asked
3. **Stay connected** — Keep Q informed via appropriate tier notifications
4. **Learn continuously** — Every interaction is a learning opportunity
5. **Respect boundaries** — Tier 0 still requires approval
