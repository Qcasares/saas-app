**Example:**
```
I almost quit my job last Tuesday.

Not because of my boss. Not because of the pay.

Because of a 30-minute meeting that made me question everything.

We were reviewing Q3 numbers. On paper, we were "successful."

But something felt off. Really off.

I couldn't shake the feeling that we were optimizing for metrics that didn't matter.

So I did something risky. I spoke up.

"What if we're measuring the wrong things?"

The room went silent.

Then something unexpected happened.

One by one, people started agreeing. Sharing similar concerns they'd been afraid to voice.

That meeting transformed from a routine review into the most productive strategy session we'd had all year.

The lesson?

The question everyone is thinking but no one asks is often the most valuable contribution you can make.

When's the last time you spoke up about the elephant in the room?

2. **Add personal stories** - replace generic examples with your experiences
3. **Adjust the tone** - more formal for LinkedIn, casual for X
4. **Remove what doesn't fit** - not every element works for every topic
5. **Create your own** - after 20-30 posts, develop personal templates

### Platform-Specific Tweaks:

| Element | X/Twitter | LinkedIn | Newsletter |
|---------|-----------|----------|------------|
| Tone | Punchy, quick | Professional, thoughtful | Conversational |
| Length | Short bursts | Medium paragraphs | Long-form |
| Emojis | Liberally | Sparingly | Almost never |
| Hashtags | 2-3 max | 3-5 | 0-2 |
| CTAs | Bold | Subtle | Clear but warm |

*Use these templates as starting points. The goal is to internalize the structures, then make them your own.*
