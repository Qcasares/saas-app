   - Test higher prices
   - Premium positioning attracts better clients

4. **One income stream**
   - Diversify from day one
   - Aim for 3+ revenue sources
   - Protect against platform changes

5. **Ignoring taxes**
   - Set aside 25-30% for taxes
   - Track income from day one
   - Consider forming an LLC
