## Executive Summary

- **OpenAI-Pentagon Deal**: OpenAI secures classified network contract after Anthropic's ethical objections trigger Trump administration retaliation
- **Agent Framework Wars**: Multiple agent orchestration platforms trending (ruflo, deer-flow, airi) signal shift toward multi-agent systems
- **Engineering Paradox**: "AI makes coding easier but engineering harder" narrative gaining traction among practitioners
- **Capex Escalation**: Meta boosts 2026 AI infrastructure spend by 73% as hyperscaler race intensifies

## Top Stories

### 1. OpenAI Strikes Pentagon Deal as Anthropic Faces Federal Ban
**Source**: [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/28/openai-strikes-deal-with-pentagon-to-use-tech-in-classified-network), [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn48jj3y8ezo), [PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-the-trump-administration-is-clashing-with-ai-firm-anthropic)  
**Why it matters**: Major geopolitical realignment in AI-military partnerships. Anthropic's ethical stance on military use triggered Trump to order all federal agencies to stop using their products. OpenAI moved swiftly to fill the gap with a classified network deployment deal. This creates a clear dichotomy: OpenAI = defense-friendly, Anthropic = ethics-first (with commercial consequences).

**Signal strength**: 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 (massive)

### 2. MicroGPT — Andrej Karpathy's Minimal GPT Implementation
**Source**: [karpathy.github.io](http://karpathy.github.io/2026/02/12/microgpt/) | HN: 1185 points, 209 comments  
**Why it matters**: Karpathy's educational implementations consistently predict industry trends. MicroGPT's minimal approach (~300 lines) suggests a shift toward smaller, more efficient models. High engagement indicates strong developer appetite for demystifying LLM internals.

**Signal strength**: 🔥🔥🔥🔥 (high)

### 3. AI Made Writing Code Easier. It Made Being an Engineer Harder
**Source**: [ivanturkovic.com](https://www.ivanturkovic.com/2026/02/25/ai-made-writing-code-easier-engineering-harder/) | HN: Rising  
**Why it matters**: Emerging counter-narrative to "AI replaces engineers" panic. Focus shifting to *engineering* (system design, architecture, debugging) vs *coding* (syntax, boilerplate). Validates investment in higher-level skills over code-generation speed.

**Signal strength**: 🔥🔥🔥 (medium-high)

## Emerging Patterns

1. **Agent Orchestration > Single Agents** — Multiple trending repos focus on multi-agent coordination rather than monolithic models
2. **Sandbox-First Development** — OpenSandbox, deer-flow emphasize isolated execution environments for AI agents
3. **Defense AI Bifurcation** — Clear split between defense-friendly (OpenAI) and ethics-restricted (Anthropic) vendors
4. **Engineering Skill Premium** — Market recognizing that AI-augmented *engineering* beats AI-augmented *coding*
