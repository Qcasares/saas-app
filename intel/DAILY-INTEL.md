## Emerging Patterns

1. **Agent Orchestration Layer**: Multiple projects (ruflo, deer-flow, OpenSandbox) building infrastructure for coordinating multiple AI agents — "swarm intelligence" as a service

2. **Context Efficiency Race**: 98% reduction tools emerging — cost optimization becoming as important as capability

3. **Voice-First Companions**: airi's realtime voice + gaming integration points to next-gen AI companions beyond chat

4. **Privacy-Preserving Sensing**: WiFi-based pose estimation removes camera requirement for spatial AI

5. **Chinese Open Source Push**: ByteDance, Alibaba actively open-sourcing agent infrastructure — geopolitical AI race playing out in GitHub stars
