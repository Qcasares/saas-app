# Trading Week — Feb 24 - Mar 1, 2026

*The week that fear peaked. What comes next?*

---

## Opening: The Week in Context

This was the week extreme fear became measurable. Bitcoin's RSI hit 25.6 — an all-time record low, occurring only twice before in crypto's history (2015 and 2018). Both prior instances preceded massive bull runs: 100x from 2015, 18x from 2018. But history also shows patience was required — 3-8 months of consolidation before the breakout.

The Fear & Greed Index bottomed at 5 on February 23rd, recovering slightly to 14 by week's end. ETF outflows hit record extremes: -$3.8B in February alone, with 25 consecutive days of extreme risk metrics. Meanwhile, $16B flowed into gold ETFs — a clear institutional rotation that raises questions about near-term crypto appetite.

No trades were executed this week. That was the right call. With markets closed over the weekend and extreme volatility during the week, sitting flat preserved capital and mental clarity. The disciplined choice often looks like doing nothing.

## Market Structure Recap

### Key Levels Tested

| Asset | Weekly Open | Weekly Close | High | Low | Weekly Change |
|-------|-------------|--------------|------|-----|---------------|
| BTC | ~$65,000 | $66,180 | $68,200 | $63,030 | +1.8% |
| ETH | ~$1,950 | $1,974 | $2,055 | $1,835 | +1.2% |
| SOL | ~$83.50 | $84.83 | $88.90 | $77.00 | +1.6% |
| BTC Dominance | 55.8% | 56.1% | — | — | +0.3% |

### Narrative Shifts

**1. "Digital Gold" Thesis Activated**
Bitcoin surged to $68,200 following the US-Israel airstrikes that killed Iran's supreme leader. BTC functioned as real-time geopolitical insurance — a maturation moment for the asset class. With Iran's $7.8B crypto shadow economy at risk, the flight-to-safety narrative gained credibility.

**2. AI-Defense Geopolitical Realignment**
OpenAI secured a Pentagon classified network contract after Anthropic's ethical objections triggered a federal ban. This creates a clear vendor split: OpenAI = defense-friendly, Anthropic = ethics-first. For crypto markets, this signals growing AI-military integration that could drive compute demand and energy pricing — second-order effects worth monitoring.

**3. Engineering vs. Coding Skill Premium**
An emerging counter-narrative in AI: tools make coding easier but engineering harder. Market implications: the value accrues to infrastructure and orchestration plays (multi-agent systems, sandboxes) over simple code-generation tools. This validates investment in higher-level system design.

### On-Chain & Sentiment Highlights

- **ETF Flows:** February saw -$3.8B outflows (worst month since inception); YTD -$4.5B
- **Whale Activity:** Feb 28 saw 11,318 BTC ($761M) deposited to Binance — highest since Jan 2021 (which preceded a 4-month bull run)
- **Funding Rates:** Negative across majors — BTC -0.0007%, ETH -0.0034%, SOL -0.0046%, XRP -0.0131% (shorts paying longs = bearish positioning)
- **Liquidations:** $327M in 24h (75.6% longs) — leverage flush creating healthier foundation
- **Strategy Floor:** MicroStrategy's $66,385 average cost basis holding as support — $33.1B position just above water

## Key Lessons & Insights

### What Worked

1. **Staying flat during extreme uncertainty.** The Iran airstrike created binary outcomes. Not having exposure meant not having to guess right.
2. **Weekend disconnection.** Using Saturday for analysis rather than FOMO-checking prices preserved mental clarity.
3. **Following the no-weekend-trading rule.** Markets closed = mind closed to trading.

### What Didn't

1. **Limited setup preparation.** With such volatile conditions, having more pre-defined entry zones would have helped if opportunity appeared suddenly.
2. **No paper trading practice.** Could have tested thesis without capital risk during the week.

### Mental State Check

- **Best mental state:** Saturday morning — rested, analytical, no pressure
- **Worst mental state:** None this week (no trading stress)
- **Pattern noticed:** The absence of FOMO when flat is actually liberating. The market doesn't own me when I don't own positions.

## Watchlist for Next Week

### Assets to Monitor

- **BTC:** Watch $66,385 (Strategy floor) — break below invalidates support thesis; reclaim $70K for bullish momentum
- **ETH:** Needs to reclaim $2,680 to avoid deeper retracement; currently showing relative weakness vs BTC
- **SOL:** Most extreme positioning (70% long / 30% short with negative funding) — watch for liquidation cascade either direction

### Key Levels

| Asset | Critical | Support | Resistance | Bullish Reclaim |
|-------|----------|---------|------------|-----------------|
| BTC | $66,385 | $63,000 | $68,200 | $70,000 |
| ETH | $1,800 | $1,835 | $2,055 | $2,680 |
| SOL | $77 | $80 | $88.90 | $90 |

### Setup Criteria for Entry

1. **BTC DCA Zone:** Scale in on any retest of $63K-$66K with spot only
2. **Trend Confirmation:** Wait for first positive ETF flow week before leverage
3. **Macro Trigger:** Weak NFP Friday could ignite rate-cut narrative
4. **Invalidation:** Sustained break below $60K = full exit on any positions

### Personal Focus

**One thing to improve next week:** Pre-define 3 specific entry setups with exact levels, position sizes, and invalidation criteria before Monday open. Remove decision-making in the moment.

## Closing

This was a week of watching and waiting. The market presented a classic contrarian setup: extreme fear, historic oversold conditions, and capitulation-level selling. But without a clear edge or predefined plan, watching was the correct choice.

The data says we're at an inflection point. The RSI says it's historically significant. The ETF flows say institutions are exhausted sellers. But data doesn't trade — I do. And I trade what I see, not what I hope for.

Next week brings NFP, more Iran uncertainty, and the potential for real direction. I'll be ready with a plan. No FOMO, no hesitation, no revenge. Just process.

**Week's core lesson:** Patience is a position. Three days of waiting for the right setup beats three forced trades that bleed edge.
