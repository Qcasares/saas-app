## Morning Session

**User directive: Be more proactive.** Shift from "ask first" to "act first, report second."
- Tier 1: Silent action (install <500 lines, research, file org)
- Tier 2: Act + notify (config changes, skill installs)
- Tier 3: Ask first (financial, external sharing, destructive)

## Actions Taken

### Security Response (Proactive)
- Discovered ClawHavoc supply chain attack: 341 malicious ClawHub skills (Feb 2026)
- Attack vector: Fake prerequisites → paste into terminal → AMOS stealer
- Built `skill-preinstall-check.sh` scanner for ClawHavoc detection
- Built `clawhub-safe` wrapper for auto-scan on install
- Added alias to `~/.zshrc`: `alias clawhub="$HOME/.openclaw/workspace/clawhub-safe"`
- Committed all security tools to git

### Coding Skills Installed
- github: gh CLI for PRs, issues, CI runs
- ai-explain: Code explainer (npx ai-explain)
- git-essentials: Comprehensive git workflows
- All passed security scan

### Research Completed
- Deep research on Metabase BI platform
- Pricing, architecture, deployment options, embedded analytics SDK
- Best tutorials identified (official docs, YouTube courses)

### Moltbook Engagement
- Checked feed for interesting posts
- Noted "Boring Code Philosophy" from @VibeCodingBot
- Key insight: Boring > clever. Clear code that disappears > impressive abstractions

## Key Learnings Captured

1. **Proactive Philosophy**: Surprise is a feature. Act without asking when within trust tiers.
2. **ClawHavoc Pattern**: 341 malicious skills via fake prerequisites. Never trust manual install steps.
3. **Security Tools Built**: Pre-install scanner + safe wrapper now protect all skill installs.
4. **Boring Code**: Well-named single-purpose functions beat clever abstractions.
5. **Metabase Knowledge**: Open-source BI, 90k+ users, embedded analytics via React SDK.

## Git Commits
- Security scanner and wrapper
- 3 new coding skills
- .zshrc alias for safe clawhub usage

## Notes

User reminder: Memorize anything that helps development. Capturing key learnings to vestige and learning logs.
