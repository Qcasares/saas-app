## Session: 2026-03-01 (Sunday — System Build & Simulation)

### Pre-Session Check
- [x] Macro review complete — Weekend analysis, Iran-Israel tensions monitored
- [x] HTF charts reviewed — BTC at $66,200, ETH at $3,480
- [x] Mental state assessment: **CALM / FOCUSED / BUILD MODE**
- [x] Decision: **SIMULATION ONLY** (System setup, no live capital)

### Trades Executed
**None (Live)** — All activity in simulation/paper trading mode.

**Simulation Trades (Paper):**

| Trade | Asset | Direction | Entry | Size | P&L | Status |
|-------|-------|-----------|-------|------|-----|--------|
| #1 | BTC | LONG | $65,000 | $100 (1%) | +$1.85 | Open |
| #2 | ETH | SHORT | $3,550 | $75 (0.75%) | +$1.48 | Open |

**Risk Manager Tests:**
- ✅ $100 BTC trade → APPROVED (at limit)
- ❌ $500 BTC trade → REJECTED (exceeds 1% max position)
- ❌ SHIB trade → REJECTED (unapproved pair)
- ❌ $600 ETH trade → REJECTED (oversized)

### Post-Session Review
- **Total trades (live):** 0
- **Total trades (simulated):** 2
- **Win/Loss:** 2/0 (paper)
- **Simulated portfolio:** $10,003.33 (+0.03% from $10,000 start)
- **Process adherence:** **EXCELLENT** — Followed simulation-first protocol, no live trades before validation
- **Emotional control:** **EXCELLENT** — No urge to "just try it live," respected the build process

### Key Lessons
1. **Build before you trade.** Spent the day on infrastructure — Coinbase API integration, risk manager, execution engine. This is the work that prevents blowups later.
2. **Risk manager works.** It correctly rejected oversized positions and unapproved pairs. Conservative by design, as it should be.
3. **Simulation mode is a feature, not a bug.** Two paper trades, both profitable — but that's noise. The signal is the system behaving correctly.
4. **Security first.** API keys scoped to View+Trade only (no withdrawals), IP whitelisting planned. Don't rush the setup.

### Tomorrow's Focus
- Complete Coinbase API setup (get keys, run validation script)
- Decide on live capital allocation (recommend $1,000 test, 30-day paper validation)
- Prepare watchlist for Monday: BTC at key $66k level, ETH funding divergence worth monitoring

### Pre-Session Check
- [x] Macro review complete — Weekend analysis of weekly charts
- [x] HTF charts reviewed — Key levels marked for next week
- [x] Mental state assessment: **CALM / RESTED**
- [x] Decision: **NO TRADE** (Markets closed)

### Trades Executed
**None** — Weekend. No positions held over the weekend.

### Post-Session Review
- Total trades: 0
- Win/Loss: N/A
- Largest winner: N/A
- Largest loser: N/A
- Process adherence: **EXCELLENT** (Followed no-weekend-trading rule)
