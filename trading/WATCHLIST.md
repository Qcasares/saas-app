## Active Setups

### 🔶 BTC/USD — ACCUMULATION ZONE
**Status:** WATCH / ACCUMULATE  
**Current:** $66,180  
**Setup:** Historic oversold accumulation

**Thesis:**
- RSI at 25.6 (all-time low, only 3rd sub-30 in history)
- Fear & Greed at 14 (Extreme Fear, recovering from 5)
- Strategy cost basis at $66,385 acting as floor
- Negative funding rates suggest short squeeze potential
- Prior sub-30 RSI readings (2015, 2018) preceded 18x-100x rallies

**Entry Zones:**
- Primary: $63,000 - $66,500 (current zone)
- Aggressive: $60,000 - $63,000 (if panic selling occurs)

**Invalidation:** Sustained close below $60,000

**Targets:**
- T1: $70,000 (psychological, 1:2 R/R)
- T2: $75,000 (resistance cluster)
- T3: $100,000+ (trend reversal)

**Position Sizing:** 1-2% risk max
**Leverage:** Spot or 2x maximum
**Timeframe:** Multi-month hold

**Alerts:**
- 🔔 Price below $66,000 (Strategy floor approach)
- 🔔 Price below $63,000 (panic selling)
- 🔔 RSI crosses above 30 (momentum shift)
- 🔔 ETF inflows turn positive (institutional reversal)

### 🔶 ETH/USD — WAIT
**Status:** STAND ASIDE  
**Current:** $1,974  
**Setup:** No clear edge — underperforming

**Thesis:**
- ETH -60% from ATH vs BTC -47% — relative weakness
- 83.6% of liquidations were longs — extreme pain
- Institutions rotating from ETH to gold/BTC
- Needs to reclaim $2,680 for bullish structure

**Entry:** NO ENTRY — wait for $2,680 reclaim

**Invalidation:** Close below $1,800

**Note:** Better risk-reward in BTC currently. ETH may outperform later in cycle but not yet.

---

### 🔶 SOL/USD — HIGH RISK / HIGH REWARD
**Status:** WATCH / SPECULATIVE  
**Current:** $84.83  
**Setup:** Extreme positioning divergence

**Thesis:**
- Strongest large-cap recovery (+7.56% intraday)
- 70.1% long / 29.9% short with negative funding (-0.0046%)
- Tension must resolve — liquidation cascade likely
- Could squeeze to $100+ OR dump to $70

**Entry:** NO ENTRY — wait for resolution

**Trade Plan:**
- IF breaks $90 with volume → Long toward $100
- IF breaks below $80 → Short toward $70
- This is a breakout play, not a range trade

**Position Sizing:** 0.5% risk max (speculative)
**Leverage:** None — spot only

**Note:** Dangerous setup. Wait for directional resolution before entering.
